# Killer Asynchronous Scripting Language (KASL) Subsystem

KASL is a very lightweight subsystem for scripting language support. The goal is to support these objectives:

- A super simple functional language
- JSON input and output
- Tokenization of text files
- Python scripting
- LUA scripting (eventually)
